# Project RASDOF
A repository containing the files to move a 6DOF Robot Arm using the LEAP Motion Controller.

## Version
1.1

## Project Report
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17nsAcFaOkZNiIQ-9kArN_2-9rsQgJNsoiEjj_89Melo/edit#

## Future Implementations
- [ ] Add Bluetooth Capability
- [ ] Add Websocket Capability
- [ ] Replace current robot end effector with a robot hand
- [ ] Movement control of robotic platform with operator's non master hand
- [ ] Haptic Gloves for respnsive feedback on operator's master hand

## Folders within the Repository

**1. Arduino**               
- Contains the Arduino scripts for servo caliberation and interfacing with the Python scripts through Serial Communication.

**2. Project RASDOF v1.1 - All in One**
- Contains the Arduino and Python folders. The Python folder contains the Python scripts and required Python files.

**3. Python**                            
- Contains the Python scripts that needs modification if required.

**4. Required Python Files** 
- Contains the necessary Python scripts to run LEAP Motion Controller.


To begin using the files, it is recommended to downloaded the Project RASDOF v1.1 All in One folder as the Python and Arduino Scripts are already in the correct directory.
